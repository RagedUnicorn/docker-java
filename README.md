# docker-java

> A docker base image to build a container for Java based on Alpine

This image is intended to build a base for providing an environment for java applications with openjdk.

## Version

* openjdk8
* openjdk8-jre

For an exact version see `Dockerfile`

## Build

### Build release image

To build an image use docker-compose.

```
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

### Build development image

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build --no-cache
```

## Test

To do basic tests of the structure of the container use the `docker-compose.test.yml` file.

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up`

For more info see [container-test](https://github.com/RagedUnicorn/docker-container-test).

Tests can also be run by category such as command and metadata tests by starting single services in `docker-compose.test.yml`

```
# command tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-test-command
# metadata tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-test-metadata
```

The same tests are also available for the development image.

```
# command tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-dev-test-command
# metadata tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-dev-test-metadata
```
